        <h2>Description</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Keep improving your bot by developing new skills for it. We suggest a simple guessing game that will predict the age of a user.</p>
        <p>It's based on a simple math trick. First, take a look at this formula:</p>
        <pre><code class="java theme-light highlight">age = (remainder3 * 70 + remainder5 * 21 + remainder7 * 15) % 105<br></code></pre>
        <p>The numbers<code class="java">remainder3</code>, <code class="java">remainder5</code> and <code class="java">remainder7</code> are the remainders of division by 3, 5 and 7 respectively.</p>
        <p>It turns out that for each number ranging from <em>0</em> to <em>104</em> the calculation will result in the number itself. This perfectly fits the ordinary age range, doesn't it? Ask a user for the remainders and use them to guess the age!</p>

    <div>
        <h2>Objective</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>At this stage, you will introduce yourself to the bot. It will greet you by your name and then try to guess your age using arithmetic operations.</p>
        <p>Your program should print the following lines:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-no-highlight theme-light highlight">Hello! My name is Aid.<br>I was created in 2020.<br>Please, remind me your name.<br>What a great name you have, Max!<br>Let me guess your age.<br>Enter remainders of dividing your age by 3, 5 and 7.<br>Your age is {yourAge}; that's a good time to start programming!<br></code></pre>
        <p>Read three numbers from the standard input. Assume that all the numbers will be given on separate lines.</p>
        <p>Instead of <code class="java">{yourAge}</code>, the bot will print the age determined according to the special formula discussed above.</p>
    </div>

        <h2>Example</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>The greater-than symbol followed by space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Notice that it's not the part of the input.</p>
        <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> <em>a dialogue with the bot</em></p>
        <pre><code class="language-no-highlight theme-light highlight">Hello! My name is Aid.<br>I was created in 2020.<br>Please, remind me your name.<br>&gt; Max<br>What a great name you have, Max!<br>Let me guess your age.<br>Enter remainders of dividing your age by 3, 5 and 7.<br>&gt; 1<br>&gt; 2<br>&gt; 1<br>Your age is 22; that's a good time to start programming!<br></code></pre>
        <p>Use the provided template to simplify your work. You can change the text, but not the number of printed lines.</p>
